Problem Solved in Projects
For this project, I analyzed the run-time  of data structures and implemented sorting and printing for a list of Computer Science courses.

Approach to the Problem
I chose the best data structure to solve the problem efficiently, as understanding them is critical for writing a good and scalable program.

Overcoming Roadblocks
Challenges like debugging sorting logic and optimizing run-time were overcome by breaking problems into smaller tasks, testing, and parsing the CVS file.

Expanded Approach to Software Design
These projects taught me to prioritize algorithm efficiency and to think more about how data is stored, used, and accessed.

Improved Programming Practices
Through this work, Iâ€™ve improved my ability to write clean, maintainable, and adaptable code, focusing on clarity, modularity, and future scalability.
